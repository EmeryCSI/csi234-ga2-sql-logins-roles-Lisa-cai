1.Explain the different types of permissions you assigned (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and what each allows a user to do.
Select allows users to read a table.
Insert allows users to insert new data into a table
The update allows users to modify existing data.
Delete allows users to delete row.

2.Describe the concept of schema-level permissions vs. table-level permissions.
Schema-level permissions allow a user to access all objects within that schema.
Schema includes tables, views, etc. Table lever permissions allow users to control specific tables.

3.Explain how column-level permissions work and why they might be useful.
Column-level permissions are used to control access to specific columns. For example, the IT role is
denied the ability to modify the employee salary column.

4.Discuss the principle of least privilege and how it's applied in this RBAC setup.
The principle of least privilege is giving users minimum permissions to access data to complete
their jobs. RBAC setup in SQL sends users into different roles to control their access permission.
The Principle of least privilege is implemented by RBAC setup.

5.Explain the potential security benefits of using roles instead of assigning permissions directly to users.
Using roles makes it easy to update or change a user's access permissions. We only need to change the role 
function to achieve it. Directly assigning permissions to users is different. We need to find a specific user to update the data.
